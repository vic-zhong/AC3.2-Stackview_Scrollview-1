### 1. Background
As the name would imply, a `UIScrollview` is a view that allows for scrolling: vertically, horizontally, or both. It also allows for zooming in and out of its content. It's nearly impossible to come across an app that doesn't make use of a scroll view or one of it's subclasses (ie. `UITableView`, `UICollectionView`, `UITextView`). And for good reason: space is extremely limited on an iPhone screen, so in order to be able to see content there needs to be a way to move through a view with dimensions larger than the screen. 

Scroll views can be somewhat tricky to work with however, as they have one very important nuance to them regarding the interaction between a scrollview's frame, bounds and content. Ole Begemann's blog post explains this topic extremely well, and if you need I would suggest to refer to that blog's reading sections and animated gif.

From the "Working with Scroll Views" link, this section is of particular importance to keep in mind:
> To support scroll views, the system interprets constraints differently, depending on where the constraints are located.
  - Any constraints between the scroll view and objects outside the scroll view attach to the scroll view’s frame, just as with any other view.
  - For constraints between the scroll view and its content, the behavior varies depending on the attributes being constrained:
     - Constraints between the edges or margins of the scroll view and its content attach to the scroll view’s content area.
     - Constraints between the height, width, or centers attach to the scroll view’s frame.
  - You can also use constraints between the scroll view’s content and objects outside the scroll view to provide a fixed position for the scroll view’s content, making that content appear to float over the scroll view.

That excerpt will become more relevant as we work with scroll views since making sure that our `contentSize` is being set correctly will be one of the more difficult things faced with using scroll views. Interface builder simplifies this a bit, to its credit.

### 2. Simple Scrolling

1. In `Main.storyboard`, drag in a `UIScrollView` onto the `MainViewController` provided. Set it's constraints as: 
  2. `0 pt` on the top, left, and right (do not constrain to margins).
  3. Set the scroll view's `.bottom` to be equal to the view's `.centerY`
  4. ![Center Y Constraint](http://i.imgur.com/yGJx6Yem.png)
4. Drag in 3 `UIView`s into the scroll view. For each view, set it's background color to something other than white (so we can visually identify them). After that, add the following constraints (you may want to have all three views selected for this):
  4. ![Pre-Constraint Views](http://i.imgur.com/WGpJOFEm.png)
  5. `width` & `height`: `400 pt`
  6. `leading` & `trailing`: `20 pt`
  7. `top` & `bottom` : `100 pt`
  8. Then name each view based on it's background color.
  9. Note: For the demo, the left-to-right order of views are: `blueView`, `orangeView`, `redView`
  10. ![Post-Constraint Views](http://i.imgur.com/S794APKm.png)
8. Run the project at this point and observe the scroll view's behavior

What exactly is going on? 
*Note: You should be observing scrolling in both the x and y axis*

We defined the `frame` of the scroll view to be the top half of the screen (top, left, right margins pinned, bottom pinned to the view's centerY). Since we gave an unbroken chain of constraints to the `UIView`s inside of the scroll view, the scrollview is able to calculate it's `contentSize` based on that. Since the `contentSize` will exceed the size of the `frame` we gave it, it extends further in both the x and y axis. The result, is a scroll view that has both horizontal and vertical scrolling. 

> Debug and Discuss
What would happen if we move the scroll view's bottom constraint to be equal to its superview's bottom constraint? Go ahead and make that change now.

1. Add an outlet from the scroll view to the `MainViewController` named `scrollView`
  1. Note that the background for the scroll view has been changed to a different color to better visualize it
  2. ![Full Height Scroll](http://i.imgur.com/demSnDwm.png)
2. In `viewDidAppear`, add the following and take note of the differences between the values when you run the project: 
```swift
  override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)
    
    print("Content Size: \(self.scrollView.contentSize)")
    print("ScrollView Bounds: \(self.scrollView.bounds)")
    print("ScrollView Frame: \(self.scrollView.frame)")
    
    print("View Frame: \(self.view.frame)")
    print("View Bounds: \(self.view.bounds)")
  }
```

1. Back in storyboard, remove the `height` constraints of all three scroll view subviews. 
1. You will now get an error about needing constraints for Y position or height. 

- You may think of this as a mistake, after all you still have constraints to define the distance of the views to the top of the scrollview, the spacing between the views, the view widths, and the distance of the bottom of the views to the scroll view bottom which in turn is pinned to the bottom of it's view. Shouldn't the height of the views now just expand to accomodate the vertical set of constraints?
  - This is where that excerpt from before starts to make sense: 

> - For constraints between the scroll view and its content, the behavior varies depending on the attributes being constrained:
     - Constraints between the **edges** or **margins** of the scroll view and its content **attach to the scroll view’s content area.**
     - Constraints between the height, width, or centers attach to the scroll view’s frame.

We defined our three view's top and bottom edges relative to the top and bottom edges of the scroll view, which then get attached to it's content area. The problem is that the content area has a `CGSize` of `(0, 0)`, and it stays that way until it's content gives it a defined size!

In order to resolve, set the view's top/bottom margin relative to a view other than the scroll view. Since the only other view is the `MainViewController`'s view, let use that. 

1. Select left-most view in the scroll view's subviews (in my case `blueView`), and CTRL+Drag to `MainViewController`'s view, creating a vertical constraint to the top layout guide, and another one to it's bottom layout guide. This is all you should need. Rerun the project at this point. 

![Finalized Constraints](http://i.imgur.com/VC6d0xI.png)

Here's a breakdown of why this works:
1. The `blueView` explicitly sets it's `height` when you create the constraints relative to `MainViewController.view`'s top and bottom layout guides
  2. This is what creates the vertical unbroken chain of constraints needed
3. The `blueView` also has constraints relative to the scroll view (`100pt` margins on top and bottom.)
  4. Since the `blueView` explicitly has its height now, the scroll view uses that value to determine the `height` of its `contentSize`:
    5. (100pts to top + `blueView.height` + 100pts to bottom)
  6. Now that the `contentSize.height` is determined, the other two views (`redView` & `orangeView`) use that information to lay themselves out
    7. Both those views end up with the same height as `blueView` because it was `blueView` that was used to determine the `contentSize.height`. And since `redView` and `orangeView` have the same top/bottom constraints relative to the scroll view's content area as `blueView`, they all end up the same.

### Exercise
1. Remove the explicit width constraints of all three subviews. 
2. Add constraints to each view so that they are relative to the `MainViewController.view`. For an extra challenge, set only 1 of the view's width relative to `MainViewController.view` and the others set relative to that view. (You can use the multiplier value of the constraints to make the width some multiple of the first, or you can use a constant value)
3. It doesn't matter what size(s) for the width you choose, just make sure that the scroll view still scrolls horizontally. 
1. Select `MainViewController` and embed in a `UITabBarController`
2. Add a new view controller to the storyboard and set up the segue for it from the tab bar. 
3. Recreate this lesson, this time creating a vertically scrolling scroll view with three subviews
4. Again, it doesn't matter what sizes you make the views so long as the scroll view only scrolls vertically. 
3. Add another view controller, and set its segue to the tab bar
4. Add two scroll views such that each one takes up half of the screen (top half and bottom half, like in the lesson earlier)
5. The top scroll view should have 3 subviews and scroll vertically
6. The bottom scroll view should have 3 subviews and scroll horizontally. 
4. One last view controller, this time you're doing a nested scroll view!
5. Add a scroll view, pin it to the edges of the view controller's view.
6. Add 3 view so that the scroll view scrolls vertically only
7. Now, add another scroll view below the 3rd view
8. Add 3 views to this scroll view, and set up constraints so that the scroll view scrolls horizontally.

# Part II: Stackviews

### 1. Intro

Hopefully, the previous exercises have shown you that it isn't an entirely trivial task to work with scroll views. And yet, they're everywhere. A lot of this is mitigated by using `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` to arrange elements, but sometimes it doesn't make sense to implement either of those for very simple setups that require some degree of dynamic updating. 

That's one of the reasons Apple introduced the `UIStackView`: to streamline the vertical and horizontal layouts of views. It handles a good portion of autolayout for you, which allows you to create a UI that adapts to screen size and layout changes much more easily. Now, it doesn't handle all of the autolayout which is why it's still critical knowledge. A deep understanding of autolayout and stack views will allow you to create some pretty impressive and responsive designs. 

We're going to take a basic look at a stack view to create a horizontally scrolling row of Pokémon icons. 

---

### 2. PokéStack 
1. Drag in a new `UIViewController` into `Main.storyboard` and set it to be the initial view controller
  - *Alternatively* if you have a tab bar controller already in place, just create a connection to this view controller
2. Drag in 4 `UIImageView` and set their images to the 4 starter Pokémon (yes, Pikachu counts as a starter).
  - Set the background color of the image views to whatever you prefer, so long as it stands out on a white background
  - Change the image content mode to `Aspect Fit`. This resizing mode keeps the original image's aspect ratio and scales the image to fit inside the frame of the `UIImageView` (feel free to play around with the other content modes later to get a sense for each of them)
3. Add the 4 image views to a stack view. There are a lot of ways to add a stack view to IB
  - You can drag in either a `Horizontal Stack View` or `Vertical Stack View` from the Object Library in the right pane
  - You can select the views you'd like to place in a stack view, and then go to Editor > Embed In.. > Stack View
  - Or, you can select the views and click on the "Stack" button, conveniently located next to the "Align", "Pin" and "Resolve AutoLayout Issues" buttons on the bottom right corner of IB.
4. There are three major options to configure a stack view (refer to the Apple doc for full explanations)
  - `Axis`
  - `Alignment` 
  - `Distribution`
5. Let's make this particular stack view 
  - `Axis` = `Horizontal`
  - `Alignment` = `Fill`
  - `Distribution` = `Fill Equally`

You already probably noticed how each of these options affects the contents of the stack view. What's rather nice is that the 4 icons, collectively, have a maximum height and width of `128pt`. But on their own, they have `width` or `height` slightly smaller than `128`. For example, the Squirtle icon has a width of slightly less than `128`, so in a `Horizontal` layout with `Fill` aligment and distribution you will be able to see that the `UIImageView` becomes a bit narrower. Using these slight differences, these 4 icons are a good way to visually identify the results of changes the different options of the stack view. 

1. Now just add the following constraints to the stackview: 
  - `8pt` left and top margins
2. Run the project...
  - Ah.. bummer. I guess we'll need a scroll view
3. Select the stack view, then go to Editor > Embed In > Scroll View
4. For the scroll view, you'll need the following constraints:
  - Pin to top, left and right edges of its super view
5. For the stack view, add:
  - `8pt` top, left, right, bottom margins
  - Center Vertically In Container
6. Run the project

What's nice about using the image views (along with the stack view) is that they define their own intrinsic content size. So we have far fewer constraints needed to satisfy autolayout.

### 3. Exercises

1. Continue on and create 2 more horizontally scrolling stack views using the other two pokemon asset categories in `Assets.xcassets` ("Common Pokemon", "Uncommon Pokemon")
2. Add a label just above each stackview with that group's category
3. Select all of these views (the 3 stack views and 3 labels) and embed them in a vertical stack view
4. Now, with that vertical stack view selected, embed everything in a vertical-only scroll view. 
5. (extra) If you have time and are interested, take a look at the [AutoLayout Guide: Stack Views](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/LayoutUsingStackViews.html) link. Experiment with different layouts and see what you can create. Just be sure that your storyboard doesn't list any warnings or errors.
